If the insured needs hospitalisation as a direct 
result of an  accident  or an illness , we pay in any 
policy year  a daily cash benefit for the number 
of full days that they are in hospital  as long as: 
a the start date of the hospitalisation is 
before the end of the policy year  in which 
the insured  reaches the age of 85; 
b the start date of the hospitalisation is 30 
days after the start date of this rider  or last 
reinstatement date  (if any) of this rider 
(unless this is the result of an accident ); c we will not pay more than one dayâ€™s worth 
of the daily cash benefit  for each day of 
hospitalisation ; and 
d the total number of days of  hospitalisation 
arising from the same accident or illness  
from the same confirmed diagnosis, 
whether the hospitalisation  covers one or 
more policy years , is not more than 365 
days. Out of this, any stay in a community 
hospital must not be for more than 45 days. 
If the insured  has been discharged from 
hospital for a continuous period of more 
than 90 days, any future hospitalisation  for 
the same  accident  or illness from the same

accident  or illness . 
If the insured  is in hospital  for only part of a 
day, we will pay half of the daily cash benefit 
for that day (based on the rates in the table 
above). Whether we class the hospitalisation  as 
a full day or part of a day will depend on 
whether the hospital  charges the room rate for 
a full day or for half a day, for the day in 
question.
