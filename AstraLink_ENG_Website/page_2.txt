FOOD FOR THOUGHT
Time is the greatest tool we have for 
building wealth.  Starting to invest early allows you 
to take advantage of the power of compounding and 
can help you achieve your long-term goal at a lower 
cost. Based on an illustration by J.P. Morgan Asset 
Management , one who started investing early ends 
up with nearly double the amount of another 
individual who started only 10 years later¹. Every life stage brings 
diﬀerent priorities that 
require diﬀerent 
investing approaches. 
Have you taken the opportunity 
to build your wealth to pursue 
your interest and make plans for 
the activities you want to?1

Do not forget about your protection 
needs while focusing on your investment.  
Based on a 2017 study by the Life Insurance 
Association Singapore (LIA), on average a working 
adult in Singapore has a mortality protection gap 
of S$169,673 and Critical Illness protection gap 
of S$256,826².
