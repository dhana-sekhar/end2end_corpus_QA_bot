Enhanced Home InsuranceProtect your home against unforeseen events
We protect not just your house but also your homeâ€™s renovations2 and contents3, which could 
add up to be more valuable than your house. Enjoy coverage against insured events6 such as 
fire, theft, flood and damage due to bursting of water pipes or tanks.
Determining the coverage amount 
Because home insurance pays to restore the damages to its original state, the amount 
of coverage required for each component is the cost to rebuild your building, redo your 
renovations or purchase your contents. This is also known as the reinstatement value and may 
be different from the market value.
