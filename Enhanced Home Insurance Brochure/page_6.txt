Enhanced Home InsuranceChoice of different plan types and coverage amounts
If you get coverage that is more than the reinstatement value of your house, you are over-insured as 
insurers will only pay the amount required to restore your property to its undamaged state. Hence, 
you’re paying unnecessary premiums on additional coverage that will not be claimable.
If you get coverage that is less than the reinstatement value of your property, you are under-insured 
and will only be able to claim a proportion of the damage. So for example, if your building costs 
$500,000 to rebuild and you only get coverage of $250,000, you will only be able to get back 50% of 
any covered damage.
Our Enhanced Home Insurance offers you that value-add by giving you the flexibility to choose the 
coverage amount you need for your building, renovations and contents.
