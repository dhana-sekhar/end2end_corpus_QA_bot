Diagram is not drawn to scale. The figures used are for illustrative  purposes only.
The non-guaranteed figures above are based on the assumption that the Life Participating Fund earns a long-term average 
return of 4.25% per annum. 
Should the long-term average return be 3.00% per annum, the non-guaranteed monthly annuity payout and total illustrated 
monthly annuity payout at age 95 would be $356.45⁴ and $427.15⁴ respectively. The non-guaranteed monthly annuity payout 
and total illustrated monthly annuity payout at age 65 would be $40.05⁴ and $110.75⁴ respectively.Annuity payout
