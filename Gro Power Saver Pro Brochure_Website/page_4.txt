Gro Power Saver  PROCapital guaranteed upon maturity
Gro Power Saver Pro comes with a capital guarantee2 upon maturity. This means that you can at 
least get back all the premiums youâ€™ve paid, excluding premiums on optional rider(s), on top of 
the non-guaranteed bonuses5.
Pay premiums for only the first 3 policy years with Premium Privilege
After premiums for the policy have been paid for at least 3 years, the Premium Privilege will 
begin and premium payments will not be required for the remaining 9 years of the polic y.
Protection in case of death or terminal illness 
In the unfortunate event of death or diagnosis of terminal illness, Gro Power Saver Pro provides 
coverage6 so that you and your loved ones stay protected.
Protection for total and permanent disability (TPD before the 
anniversary immediately after the policyholder reaches the age of 70) 
In the unfortunate event of total and permanent disability (TPD before the anniversary 
immediately after the policyholder reaches the age of 70), you will not need to worry about 
paying premiums for the remaining premium term of your Gro Power Saver Pro policy7. The 
policy will continue to apply (as if premiums have been paid) during this period even though 
you are not paying the premiums. Alternatively, you may choose to receive a lump sum benefit7 
instead of having your future premiums waived at the point of claim, the policy will terminate 
after this is paid.
Receive enhanced protection against cancer
You can also choose to add on the Cancer Premium Waiver (GIO) rider, so that your future 
premiums are waived should you be diagnosed with a major cancer during the term of the rider8.
