The non-guaranteed figures above are based on the assumption that the Life Participating Fund earns a long-term average 
return of 4.25% p.a.
Should the long-term average return be 3.00% p.a., the non-guaranteed bonuses would be $14,23510, the total illustrated 
maturity benefit would be $74,23510, and the corresponding illustrated yield at maturity would be 1.95% p.a.1040
