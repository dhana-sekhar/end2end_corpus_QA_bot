Gro Retire Flex  PROIMPORTANT NOTES
20 The figures in the illustration are not guaranteed and are illustrated based on the assumption that the Life Participating Fund 
earns a long-term average return of 3.00% per annum in the future. Returns are illustrated based on estimated bonus rates 
that are not guaranteed. The actual benefit payable will vary according to the future performance of the Life Participating 
Fund. The calculation for the illustrated yield at maturity also assumes that all cash benefits and cash bonuses due for the 
entire policy term are paid out to the policyholder. If cash benefits and cash bonuses are accumulated with us, the interest rate 
will be based on 1.50% per annum and it is not guaranteed. Prevailing interest rate at the point of deposit will be determined 
by us. Any cash benefits paid under the Disability Care Benefit cannot be accumulated with us.
