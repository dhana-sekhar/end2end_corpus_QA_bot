Gro Saver Flex  PROOption to enhance coverage with our riders for regular premium 
policies
Savings Protector Pro 
In the unfortunate event of total and permanent disability (TPD before the anniversary 
immediately after you reach the age of 70), the future premiums on the basic polic y will be 
waived¹²,¹³ for the remaining premium term. The basic policy will continue to apply (as if 
premiums have been paid) during this period. A lump sum benefit equivalent to two years 
annual premium¹³ will also be paid.
With Savings Protector Pro, you will also enjoy peace of mind in the event of retrenchment . 
Should you get retrenched and stay unemployed for 3 consecutive months, you do not have 
to pay premiums for your basic policy and Savings Protector Pro rider for 6 months with our 
Retrenchment Benefit¹²,¹⁴. You will still receive the same coverage during that time and have a 
peace of mind while looking for a new job. If you remain retrenched at the end of the 5th month 
when your premiums are waived for your policy, you can choose to defer¹⁵ the payment of 
premiums for your policy for the next 6 months.
Cancer Premium Waiver (GIO)
You can also choose to add on the Cancer Premium Waiver (GIO) rider so that your future 
premiums are waived should you be diagnosed with a major cancer during the term of the rider¹⁶.
