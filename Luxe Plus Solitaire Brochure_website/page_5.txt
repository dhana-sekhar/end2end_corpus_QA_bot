How Luxe Plus Solitaire gives you an unparalleled 
advantage of passive income
Mr Tan, age 40, signs up for Luxe Plus Solitaire with a single premium of $2 million.
From the end of the 3rd policy year, the policy begins to pay monthly cash payouts1 of $6,2507. The monthly cash 
payouts1 provide a monthly income stream to Mr Tan for his various lifestyle expenses, such as luxury vacations and 
watches.
Mr Tan passes away at age 85 with no secondary insured3 appointed and his family will receive the death benefit of 
$2,320,0004,7 and the policy terminates thereafter.
However, should Mr Tan survive till a ripe old age of 120 years old, the total illustrated monthly cash payouts1 from 
age 43 to 120 would be $5,775,0007 and Mr Tan would receive a maturity benefit6 of $6,020,0007.

The non-guaranteed figures above are based on the assumption that the Life P articipating Fund earns a long-term 
average return of 4.25% p.a.
Should the long-term average return be 3.00% p.a., the total illustrated monthly cash payout1 would be $4,2608 
(the non-guaranteed monthly cash bonus1 would be $2,0808), the total illustrated monthly cash payouts1 from age 
43 to 85 would be $2,147,0408 and the death benefit would be $2,020,0004,8 when Mr Tan passes away at age 85 
with no secondary insured3 appointed.  If Mr Tan survive till a ripe old age of 120 years old, the total illustrated 
monthly cash payouts1 from age 43 to 120 would be $3,936,2408 and the maturity benefit6 would be $4,820,0008.Death beneﬁt4:
