How Mortgage Term prepares you for the unexpected
Mr Lee, age 40, is looking for a term life insurance plan to cover his mortgage loan for his new 
property. He signs up for Mortgage Term to cover his mortgage loan of $500,000, at a loan 
interest rate of 3%, for a policy term of 25 years. 
Age 40 Mr Lee signs up for Mortgage Term and pays a monthly premium of $61 for 23 
years only.
Age 50 Mr Lee suffers from a stroke that causes him to be totally and permanently 
disabled. The sum assured of $360,679 will be paid out to him and it can be 
used to pay for the remaining mortgage loan.
