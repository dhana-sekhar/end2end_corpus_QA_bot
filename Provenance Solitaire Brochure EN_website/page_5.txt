How Provenance Solitaire safeguards your heritage 
and lets you set aside sufficient funds for your 
retirement
William, age 45, non-smoker lives with his wife and two children. He has $2.5 million in cash. He wishes to leave an 
inheritance to his wife and children, with each having around $500,000. He would also like to maintain his current 
lifestyle during retirement.
Without Provenance Solitaire, William would need to set aside $1.5 million cash for inheritance and only have  
$1 million for his retirement, which may not be enough to maintain his current lifestyle.
With Provenance Solitaire, he can leave behind an inheritance for his loved ones, and still be able to enjoy his 
retirement with the remaining cash.
The figures used are for illustrative purposes only and are rounded  to the nearest dollar.

average return of 4.25% p.a.
