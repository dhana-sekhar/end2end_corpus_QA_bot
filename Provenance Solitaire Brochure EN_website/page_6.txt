 
How Provenance Solitaire helps with asset equalisation 
of a business
Richard, age 55, non-smoker, owns a small Information Technology (IT) business worth $10 million. He has two 
children. His son, Raymond is helping with the business, while his younger daughter, Renee is a lawyer and does not 
have an interest in running the family business.
Without Provenance Solitaire, it may be difficult for Richard to distribute his main asset , which is his business.
With Provenance Solitaire, Richard can comfortably leave the business to his son, Raymond to build and expand, 
while his daughter, Renee also gets a fair share of asset.
The figures used are for illustrative purposes only and are rounded  to the nearest dollar.
The illustrated death benefit above is not guaranteed and is based  on the assumption that the Life Participating Fund earns a
long-term average return of 4.25% p.a.
Should the long-term average return be 3.00% p.a., the illustrate d death benefit at age 90 would be $7,127,081⁷ instead.Scenario 1: Without Provenance Solitaire
