Travel InsuranceIMPORTANT NOTES
8 Your coverage period will be automatically extended at no extra cost for the first 14 days while you are overseas if you are:
- unable to return before the policy expires due to the delay of the public transport that you are travelling on, and the delay   
is not caused by you, or,
- hospitalised or quarantined overseas in a quarantine facility as  advised by a medical practitioner or local authorities.
9 We do not cover claims arising from a pre-existing medical condition where you have been given a terminal prognosis with 
a life expectancy of under 12 months. Please refer to policy conditions for the precise definition of pre-existing medical 
conditions.
10 To be eligible for COVID-19 cover, you must fulfill all vaccination, pre-departure tests and post-arrival tests requirements (if 
any) imposed by the destination country or transport operator at the time of the trip. You must also fulfil all the conditions in 
the relevant section of your plan. For example, under Section 1 – cancelling your trip, COVID-19 must still result in a serious 
sickness.
