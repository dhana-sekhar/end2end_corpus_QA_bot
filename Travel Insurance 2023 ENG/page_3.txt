Coverage for unexpected travel delays
We understand that be it an unexpected late plane arrival or departure, travel delays4 are 
unavoidable, which is why we provide coverage for travel delay as long as it is not caused by you.
Coverage for medical expenses
While holidays are fun, accidents are not. Accidents and mishaps may occur anywhere, anytime 
and without prior notice. Unexpected injuries or illnesses could be financially and emotionally 
draining, especially when you are in a foreign country. This is why we provide coverage for 
overseas medical expenses in case you need to seek professional treatment, so you can enjoy 
your holiday experience to the fullest with peace of mind.
In times of emergency, you and your loved ones can get the best treatment possible, without 
worrying about hefty medical bills overseas. This includes medical expenses coverage of up 
to $1,000,000 for treatment relating to COVID-19 while overseas (based on Income’s Travel 
Insurance Preferred plan for an adult under 70 years old).
