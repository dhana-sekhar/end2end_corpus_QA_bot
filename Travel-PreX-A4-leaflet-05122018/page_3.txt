Travel companions with pre-existing medical conditions
Travelling with family and friends are always worth looking forward to but what if you have to cancel your trip due to a relapse of their pre-existing medical condition? You can either continue with the planned holiday without them or stay in town so you can look after and nurse them back to pink of health. If you choose to be with them by cancelling your trip, Enhanced PreX Superior and Prestige plans provide you with the benefit for such unforeseen events.
