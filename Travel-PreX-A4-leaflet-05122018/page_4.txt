Choice of different plan types
There are 3 Enhanced PreX plans to choose from, allowing you to find one that best suits your individual needs. Enhanced 
PreX Basic plan offers basic coverage for your medical expenses resulting from your pre-existing medical conditions while you are overseas. Even though Enhanced PreX Basic plan does not provide coverage for travel inconvenience claims arising from pre-existing medical conditions, the plan still covers such claims that are not related from pre-existing medical conditions. For instance, if you cancel your trip due to natural disasters in your holiday destination and not situations resulting from pre-existing medical conditions. 
For added coverage other than medical benefits, opt for Enhanced PreX Superior plan or Enhanced PreX Prestige plan 
which covers you in the event where you have to make changes or cancel your holiday plans due to your pre-existing medical conditions.
