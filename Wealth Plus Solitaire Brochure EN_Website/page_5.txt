How Wealth Plus Solitaire gives you a lifetime of 
passive income
Mr Wong, age 50, signs up for Wealth Plus Solitaire with a single premium of $2 million.
From the end of the 4th policy year, the policy begins to pay monthly cash payouts¹ of $6,250⁷. The monthly cash 
payouts¹ provide a monthly income stream to Mr Wong for his various lifestyle expenses, such as luxury vacations 
and watches.
Mr Wong passes away at age 85 with no secondary insured³ appointed and his family will receive the death benefit 
of $2,160,000⁴,⁷ and the policy terminates thereafter.
Diagram is not drawn to scale. The figures used are for illustrative  purposes only and are rounded to the nearest dollar.
The non-guaranteed figures above are based on the assumption that the Life Participating Fund earns a long-term
average return of 4.25% p.a.
Should the long-term average return be 3.00% p.a., the total illustrated monthly cash payout¹ would be $3,840⁸ 
(the non-guaranteed monthly cash bonus¹ would be $2,400⁸), the total illustrated monthly cash payouts¹ from age 
54 to 85 would be $1,428,480⁸ and the death benefit would be $2,120,000⁴,⁸ when Mr Wong passes away at age 85 
with no secondary insured³ appointed.Death beneﬁt4:
